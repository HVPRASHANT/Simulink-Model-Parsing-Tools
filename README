##-- Simulink Mode Parsing Tools --##

This tool package intends to extend my parsing tool for SimMechancis which has a very similar structure with Simulink.

It contains 2 modules MDLparsetool and XMLparsetool:
	* One is for parsing .mdl file, which is created directly under Matlab's SimMechanics system.
	* The other one is for paring .xml file, which is generated by SimMechanics Link, a plugin for exporting CAD 	assemblies from a CAD model into SimMechanics.

The goal of this tools package is to implement the same system manipulation functions as provided in Matlab environement.
 
##-- Requirements --##
To run this tool, you'll need:
	* Python, version 2.4 or higher
	* for mdl file parser, you need to install pyparsing module

##-- Credits --##
The code for parsing mdl file into nest list was writtern by Kjell Magne Fauske.
