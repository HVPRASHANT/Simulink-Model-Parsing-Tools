##-- Simulink Mode Parsing Tools --##

This tool package intends to extend my parsing tool for SimMechancis which has a very similar structure with Simulink.

* the tools contian MDLparsetool.py for parsing .mdl file, which is created directly under Matlab's Simulink environment.
* the tools provide functions like get_param(), set_param(), add_block(), add_line() etc.

The goal of this project is to implement the same system manipulation functions as provided in Matlab environement. 
So that one can create and/or modify Simulink model by using python.
 
##-- Requirements --##
To run this tool, you'll need:
	* Python, version 2.4 or higher
	* for mdl file parser, you need to install pyparsing module

##-- Credits --##
The function for parsing mdl file into nest list was writtern by Kjell Magne Fauske. Thanks
